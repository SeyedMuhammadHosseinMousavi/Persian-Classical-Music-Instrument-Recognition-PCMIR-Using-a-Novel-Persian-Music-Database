## üìñ Abstract

Audio signal classification is an important domain in pattern recognition and signal processing. Musical instrument classification, a subset of this field, faces unique challenges due to the diverse characteristics of different instruments. This research focuses on the automatic classification of **Persian classical musical instruments** using a combination of extracted audio features. The system is designed to assist in educational and artistic settings, especially in Persian music studies.

The database includes recordings of seven Persian classical instruments:
- **Ney**
- **Tar**
- **Santur**
- **Kamancheh**
- **Tonbak**
- **Ud**
- **Setar**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54ecb81b-8519-4e3c-8e7f-325450fce269)

The classification methodology involves extracting audio features like:
- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**
- **Spectral Roll-off**
- **Spectral Centroid**
- **Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**
- **Entropy Energy**

These features are refined using **Fuzzy Entropy** for feature selection and classified using **Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLNN)**.
